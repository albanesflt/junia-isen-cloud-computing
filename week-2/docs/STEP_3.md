# Step 3: deploy an HTTP API locally

We are going to explore a small HTTP API that will connect to your database.

## Run locally

Go to [examples-api](../examples-api/) and follow the instructions from the [README.md](../examples-api/README.md).

## A few hints

- within GitHub Codespace or devcontainers, `uv` is already installed, no need to install it again
- in the exported environment variables, you should use the exact same characteristics than when you connected manually
- the "host" is interchangeable with "hostname" or "server": it means the PostgreSQL hostname/URL
